Art class teaches about geometric versus organic shapes. A building has straight lines and right angles, so it's geometric. A plant and curved lines and as many circles as angles, so it's organic. Many artists draw and paint beautiful images and fruit, flowers, landscapes, and other organic beauty. When I was in art class, given the choice, I picked geometric. I loved drawing the crisp lines, and I loved bending the angles to show perspective. When I was doodling in class, and wanted to draw what I saw, the first thing I'd see was an electric outlet.

I don't take art classes anymore. I don't draw regularly either. But, my smart phone's battery life does draw my eye to the nearest power source. And, sometimes, my camera goes there, too.
