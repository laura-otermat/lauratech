<span class="title">Nim: A Game</span>

I wanted to write something more complex in Javascript. I'd written a version of Nim for a class in college, and it seemed like a good candidate here.  My Nim: <a href="http://www.lauratech.com/?p=nim">Nim: A Game</a> Wiki for rules: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim" target="_blank">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim</a>

<span class="title">Stuff On My Website</span>

After reading a book about javascript, I modified the book's example scripts to do a few simple things.&nbsp; The first is called Acronym.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.lauratech.com/acronym">Acronym</a> is an acronym generator.&nbsp; I think acronyms are hilarious, but it takes a frustratingly long time for me to calculate them, so I created this handy acronym-generator.&nbsp; Simply type in the phrase you?d like acronym-ized and press the button.&nbsp; An acronym will then appear.

I created Oracle and Magic from the same script as Acronym.&nbsp; They both provide an answer to a yes/no question, but <a href="http://www.lauratech.com/oracle/">Oracle</a> requires you to type it out.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.lauratech.com/magic/">Magic</a> is equipped with an advanced mind-reading capability and thus does not require a typed version of your question.
