I'd be curious to hear from anybody reading my site.

If you'd like to reach me, my email is: laura@lauratech.com.

The sections "Stuff", "Post", and "Videos" are for different things I've made.  "Stuff" is programs I've written.  You can read more about them by clicking on "Stuff" or use them by clicking on the titles.  "Posts" is articles I've written about different, sometimes geeky, things I'm interested in.  "Tools" is a list of recommended tools I've used to write my blog.  "Videos" is a slew of youtube videos I've recorded and uploaded.  "Flirting in Hexadecimal" and "Cursing in Binary" are by far my favorites.  They get less geeky as you go down the list. "Friends" are people I know who also have blogs I'd recommend perusing.
